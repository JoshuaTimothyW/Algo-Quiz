# Quiz 2

- Case A : "Final Recursion"
- Case B : "Train : Star"
- Case C : "You Must Be This Tall to Ride"
- Case D : "Secret Esmsage"
- Case E : "Minimum"

# Notes

- Case A :
Just follow the case instruction using recursion.

- Case B : 
Just like the case instruction, the case based on star network topology. The star topology satisfy 3 conditions: One node has degree of number of vertex-1, all nodes except central node have degree 1, and number of edges equal to number of vertices-1.

- Case C : 
The trick is use 2 binary search for minimum and maximum value. 

- Case D : 
Input all indexes in array, then print every single char based on value from the array.

- Case E : 
Create a struct to store number and index. Then use sort struct based on the number, next is to use binary search to get minimum number.
